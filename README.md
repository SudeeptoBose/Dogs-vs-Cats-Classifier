# Dogs-vs-Cats-Classifier

I used a dataset from kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/arpitjain007/dog-vs-cat-fastai"

Make sure to run the "Dogs vs Cats.ipynb" file first. It's the preprocessing stage before the training.

It saves the processed data in pickle files.

Those files and then used in training_modules.py.

Depending on how the model is modified, the accuracy of the prediction model will change. 

Current model has a 80.05% accuracy
